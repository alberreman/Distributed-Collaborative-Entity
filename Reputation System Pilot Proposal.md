**Reputation System Pilot Proposal**

I propose a P2p evaluation system, conducted weekly in short survey form to
achieve the following purposes:

-   bootstrap a reputation system for reputation-based voting, later to be put
    on-chain

-   build horizontal accountability

-   build communication skills within teams

-   merit-based decision-making

-   Empower worker self-organization

-   provide employees with clear understanding of expectations and performance

-   recognize successful employees

-   Identify areas for improvement

**Description:** Employees would complete 10 minute weekly surveys wherein they
would rate their co-workers’ recent performance in three areas on a scale of
1-3. There may be more than 3 areas of evaluation, but each individual would
only be required to rate 3 performance areas each week. Workers would then be
given access to their scores on a monthly basis.

If adopted in the long term, only monthly average reputation/evaluation scores
would be input on-chain, as to minimize on-chain storage costs.

**Individual Evaluation System**

**Scale 1-3.**

-   1 = Requires support

-   2 = Meets expectations. Good job!

-   3 = Remarkably excellent

**Rate the degree to which this individual demonstrated the following skills in
the last week:**

-   Respectful communication and listening

-   Time management

-   Work quality

-   Punctual with arrivals and deadlines

-   Dependability/reliability

-   Initiative

-   Sound judgement

-   Cooperation

>   Additionally, there may be a system to rate team performance. Team
>   reputation scores could then impact individuals’ reputation within that
>   team, as to reflect the interdependency of work performance and build team
>   comradery. This could be accomplished two ways: the average individual
>   reputation score of each team could be weighted in some way to affect each
>   team member’s score; or, executives could rate each team on a scale of 1-3,
>   and that score could be weighted in some way to affect each team member’s
>   score.
