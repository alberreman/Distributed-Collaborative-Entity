# Distributed-Collaborative-Entity
Open Source Governance


 This repository will follow the development of the Blockchains new corporate governance model, the distributed collaborative entity (DCE).  For an introduction to our mission, please read the "Intro Blog Post" document.
  
<b>Disclaimer:</b> Look. We’re open-sourcing our governance model. That means you’re seeing something that isn’t complete and isn’t perfect, and that we haven’t fully figured out or agreed upon yet. It’s a work in progress. We’re making it transparent so that you can contribute your ideas and note our mistakes or oversights, and make a more robust system in the process: not to declare commitment to the exact governance framework laid out here.
