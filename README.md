# Distributed-Collaborative-Entity


 This repository will follow the development of the Blockchains new corporate governance model, the distributed collaborative entity (DCE).  For an introduction to our mission, please read the "Intro Blog Post" document.
  
<b>Disclaimer:</b> Look. We’re open-sourcing our governance model. That means you’re seeing something that isn’t complete and isn’t perfect, and that we haven’t fully figured out or agreed upon yet. It’s a work in progress. We’re making it transparent so that you can contribute your ideas and note our mistakes or oversights, and make a more robust system in the process: not to declare commitment to the exact governance framework laid out here. 

<b> On Moving Slow </b>

I know that there’s a big emphasis on shipping in this industry, so I am conscious of the slow rate at which we’re developing our governance framework, and I feel the need to defend our pace. What we are building is necessarily experimental and innovative, but it must also be robust and practical, because we are an ambitious company of 80+ and growing; there is a lot at stake if we fail. This means we’re taking our time and giving thoughtful consideration to how we want decisions made, and who we want to make them. We cannot and will not settle for a simple permissionless coin vote DAO to make major decisions that will affect the futures of so many workers, and determine the ethical backbone and success of our company, services, and products. It’s also true that I am the project lead, and my background is in literature, composition and rhetoric, and social work. Corporate governance is new to me, my relationship with Ethereum is still young, and I don’t code. That means I spend a lot of times learning from people with more knowledge and experience than I do in those areas.
