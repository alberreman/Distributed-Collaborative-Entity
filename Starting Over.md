**Starting Over**

After a series of unsuccessful proposals and months of failed communication
efforts, I am starting back from the beginning -with a new (old) boss and a new
communication strategy. Previous efforts to understand the reasoning behind and
definitions of stakeholder groups have been unsuccessful, as have been my
efforts to understand what "full stakeholder control" means. In another attempt
to understand the former, I have outlined the stakeholder groups heretofore
mentioned and my understanding of how Jeff sees these groups and why he wanted
to include them - with no commentary or judgement made whatsoever - just to
clarify. In an attempt to understand the desired level and type of stakeholder
control, I have outlined a spectrum of possibilities for stakeholder involvement
in governance - all of which could be understood as allowing "full control" to
stakeholders.
