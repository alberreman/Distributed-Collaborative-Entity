<b> A proposed set of values for collaborative partnerships. </b>


Prosperity need not be a scarce resource. The success of every company is a collaborative effort enabled by overlapping,
cooperating, and competitive communities of stakeholders. Just as the success of every company is a product of interdependence, the prosperity won through this collaboration should be shared. Blockchains is
therefore committed to serving these communities in all our products, services,
and partnerships. To best serve these communities, we aim to empower individuals
from these groups to participate in the governance of our organization, and we
have developed a set of guiding principles to govern our relationships and joint
projects with collaborative entities:

-   Privacy is a civil right.

-   Technological systems are first and foremost human systems, and as such
    should be built to best enable a freer, more open and fair future.
    
-   Individuals should have input in the development and design of systems, technological or
    otherwise, that affect them.
   
-   Individuals unsatisfied with the systems affecting them have the right to
    exit them.

-   Stakeholder access to verifiable information regarding partnerships and business practices is a prerequisite for democratic governance.


-   We strive to create products and services that repair and support healthy
    ecosystems by sustainably promoting biodiversity and responsible energy
    usage.

-   Employees are entitled to market-competetive compensation.

-   Ethical products and services are best created through partnership with consumers to identify and serve their needs.

-   Individuals have the right to control access to their data.

-   Technology should enable accessibility to people of diverse abilities.


We seek to transform the relationship between businesses and the communities
supporting them to best leverage our shared interests to realize a more
human-centric future. We will use blockchain technology to create more
democratic, transparent, and efficient alternatives to legacy systems, including
but not limited to our financial, information, energy, corporate and political
institutions. Together, we can incubate and implement technology to the mutual
benefit of our companies, employees, and communities – both local and global –
and create a blueprint for a brighter future.
