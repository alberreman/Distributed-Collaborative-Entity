<b><h1> Final Preamble for MOUs.</b> </h1>

<i> A collective document created by Stephanie Sciarani, Jeff Benson, Rainik Soni, Haley Summers, Alison Berreman, and Sena Lloyd </i>


We seek to bring about a more human-centric future by transforming the relationship between businesses and the communities they serve. We will use blockchain and other technologies to create more democratic, transparent, and efficient alternatives to legacy systems, including but not limited to our financial, corporate, and political institutions. 

The following guiding principles will govern our relationships and joint projects:

•	Technological systems are first and foremost human systems. As such, they should be built to enable a more free and fair future.

•	Ethical products and services are best created through partnership with individuals to identify and serve their needs; individuals should be viewed not merely as consumers, but as partners who provide input toward the development and design of systems that affect them.

•	To protect individuals and their data, we will work toward creating a community that places all decisions regarding the use of individual data in the hands of the individual, thereby empowering them to control access to their information.

•	Public blockchain technology will be used, wherever possible and practical, to create more efficient, equitable, and transparent systems in a wide range of domains, including energy consumption distribution, and storage, financial services, public and private governance, physical and digital asset ownership, health and human services, entertainment, arts, and culture.

•	We pledge to implement ecology-based planning, design, and development in all shared projects and leverage only renewable energy sources or energy-efficient technology in our collective work. 

•	We strive to create products and services that repair and support our natural environment. 

It is our intent that together, we will incubate and implement emerging technologies in a way that benefits our companies, our employees, our communities, and the entire world – and in doing so, create the blueprint for a revolutionary new corporate and social model.

<b><h2> My original proposed set of values for collaborative partnerships. </h2></b>


Prosperity need not be a scarce resource. The success of every company is a collaborative effort enabled by overlapping,
cooperating, and competitive communities of stakeholders. Just as the success of every company is a product of interdependence, the prosperity won through this collaboration should be shared. Blockchains is
therefore committed to serving these communities in all our products, services,
and partnerships. To best serve these communities, we aim to empower individuals
from these groups to participate in the governance of our organization, and we
have developed a set of guiding principles to govern our relationships and joint
projects with collaborative entities:

-   Privacy is a civil right.

-   Technological systems are first and foremost human systems, and as such
    should be built to best enable a freer, more open and fair future.
    
-   Individuals should have input in the development and design of systems, technological or
    otherwise, that affect them.
   
-   Individuals unsatisfied with the systems affecting them have the right to
    exit them.

-   Stakeholder access to verifiable information regarding partnerships and business practices is a prerequisite for democratic governance.


-   We strive to create products and services that repair and support healthy
    ecosystems by sustainably promoting biodiversity and responsible energy
    usage.



-   Ethical products and services are best created through partnership with consumers to identify and serve their needs.

-   All use of data created by individuals' interaction with our products and services must be consensual and transparent.

-   Technology should enable accessibility to people of diverse abilities.


We seek to transform the relationship between businesses and the communities
supporting them to best leverage our shared interests to realize a more
human-centric future. We will use blockchain technology to create more
democratic, transparent, and efficient alternatives to legacy systems, including
but not limited to our financial, information, energy, corporate and political
institutions. Together, we can incubate and implement technology to the mutual
benefit of our companies, employees, and communities – both local and global –
and create a blueprint for a brighter future.
