**Big Burning Questions:**

What happens to VP and PS when a SH group is added or removed?

**REMOVING A STAKEHOLDER GROUP:**

There are a couple of ways this COULD happen. You could redistribute the shares
of the foregone SH group evenly among the leftover SH groups, or you could
redistribute it according to the ratio of power each existing stakeholder group
has in comparison to the other remaining stakeholder groups. The implications
for each decision are best exemplified if the stakeholder group that left the
DCE had a very significant share of the VP.

Ex: there are four SH groups, each with different voting power: A has 1 %, B has
2%, C has 3%, and D has 94%.

>   Possibility \#1: If you evenly split D’s votes across the remaining
>   stakeholder group, A, B, and C, and give each SH group roughly 31.33%, you
>   have created a system where each SH group has almost the same VP: A 32.33, B
>   33.33, C 34.33.

>   Possibility \#2: You could distribute the votes such that it considers the
>   relative VP between the existing SH groups. In this example, when A is 1%
>   and B has 2%, B has twice the amount of VP as A, and C has 150% of B. In
>   this way of distributing VP, A = 16.66, B = 33.32, and C = 49.99. In other
>   words, you could essentially just “get rid of” the votes from the foregone
>   SH group, so that A= 1/6, B = 2/6, and C =3/6

**ADDING A STAKEHOLDER GROUP:**

**Fostering a Culture of Solidarity; Against Zero Sum Outcomes**

It may be unlikely that a stakeholder group be added by the DCE, because the
addition of a new group would dilute the voting power and profit rights of the
existing stakeholders, making against their individual self-interests. It may be
more likely that the DCE accepts a new stakeholder group before the company
becomes profitable, when it is only voting power that is diluted. Though, of
course, voice is also an alluring power.

However, by nature the DCE is a collaborative entity, designed to accommodate
(or at least formally consider) the interests of diverse stakeholders. It may be
the case that the meeting of these groups creates a culture of solidarity. It
may also be the case that it creates a culture of competition. Ideally, as in
any good democracy, stakeholders will work together against zero sum outcomes
wherever possible and facilitate civil - nay - *friendly* discourse around truly
competitive interests. To help foster a civil community culture, board members
and/or stakeholder groups may receive trainings in horizontal leadership or some
other solidarity-building, conflict-management training.

**Known Future Stakeholders**

If there is a group that is known from the beginning of the DCE’s formation to
be a future stakeholder, but that does not yet exist, their right to stakeholder
group status could be written into the company’s bylaws. For example, there
should be some representation for the Smart City within the DCE, but there is
not currently a community living and working on Blockchains’ land (though there
are businesses who occupy land in the same general area, including commercial
storefronts, factories, distribution centers, food, hotels, etc). To ensure that
the city get representation, we could write their right to representation into
the bylaws. Of course, bylaws could be amended, but this does offer some
protections.

**Maintenance of Proportionate Power**

Given the scenario where a new stakeholder group is identified and brought into
the fold, it should be the case that the ratios of voting power (and profit
sharing) between pre-existing stakeholder groups remains the same, such that no
new stakeholder group disproportionately affects one stakeholder group over
another.

>   Ex: Three stakeholder groups exist, each with 1/3 of the voting power. A new
>   one is added who will now have 1/6 of the total voting power. The three
>   original stakeholder groups should all still have equal voting power to each
>   other – in this case each of the original three SH groups now has 5/18 of
>   the total VP.

The caveat to this is in the case of one stakeholder group that decides to split
into two or more sub groups. In this case, the profit sharing and voting rights
of each “new” stakeholder group is taken from the original, and negotiated
within the affected SH group.

>   Ex: There are three stakeholder groups, each with 1/3 of the total voting
>   power. One group decides to become two. It could decide that the split is
>   even, with each half now possessing 1/6 of the total voting power, or ½ of
>   the original stakeholder group’s. Or, it could split voting power in some
>   other way: Maybe one of the stakeholder group has twice the power of the
>   other, such that one half has 2/9 of the total voting power, and the other
>   has 1/9. No matter, the power of the existing stakeholder groups remains the
>   same.

**How Much Power Should Each Stakeholder Group Receive?**

This is one of the hardest questions. Status as a “stakeholder” is defined by a
group’s ability to be affected by and contribute to the success of Blockchains
(as defined in the company’s forthcoming bylaws/constitution/manifesto), but it
is difficult to quantify the value any one group brings to the whole, or could
bring to the whole if given more power.

Who is given power within an organization says a lot about that organization’s
values, so it follows that this question should be answered in consideration of
the company’s values and purpose (what it must achieve to consider itself
‘successful’). But, again, the degree to which a stakeholder group embodies
company values, or can aid in realizing those values in our business endeavors,
is all but impossible to quantify. Metrics could be created, but what is
measured is a subjective and highly consequential choice. In consideration of
the subjective nature of this problem, there should be no precise protocol or
formula for coming to a decision. The best we can do in this circumstance is
designate the decision-makers and some rubric/criteria for consideration.

**Decision-Makers for Designating SH Group power and rights:**

*This is a board responsibility, to be decided separately from whether the group
should be added at all. Ex: Should this group be allowed? If so, how much VP?
How much profit?* This is to ensure that whether a group is added is considered
apart from how much power they should receive, so that if directors deny the
proposal it is clear that it is due to their outright rejection of the group as
a SH group, and not because of some dispute over the precise amount of power
they are given.

While this is ultimately a board responsibility, stakeholders are given the
opportunity for input during the universal ballot following the board’s decision
to admit a new stakeholder group. That ballot would then also be a two-part
question: “*Should this group be allowed? If so, how much VP? How much profit?”*
However, due to the board’s small size, representatives will be allowed an exact
figure (the new stakeholder group should receive 10% of the total voting power),
whereas the universal ballot will only allow voters to choose between a set of
ranges ( A. 1-10%, B. 11-20%, C. 21-30%). If the board-chosen number lays within
the most-selected universal-ballot decided range, then that number stands. If
the most selected option falls outside of the board-decided option, then the
newly admitted stakeholder group’s power will be equal to the average between
the board’s number and the number in the selected range closest to the board’s.

>   Example: The board decides the new group should have 20% of the voting
>   power, but the stakeholders decide that the group should get between 1-10%
>   of the vote. In this case, the actual voting power of the newly admitted
>   stakeholder group is 15%.

**Criteria:** (to be expanded upon.)

When deciding how much voting power a new stakeholder group should get, board
members should consider:

The degree to which the group is affected by the success of the DCE

Any expertise or special knowledge that might make this group more adept at
realizing certain outcomes

>   How the inclusion of the new group will affect the overall balance of power
>   within the DCE (you don’t want to give any one group majority vote, or any
>   two groups that align but whose interests are aligned but
>   antagonistic/competitive with the other groups).

When deciding what their right to profits might be, board members should
consider:

Does this group have collective interests that they could use money to advance
together?

To what extent does this group advance the financial interests of the company?
