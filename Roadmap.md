**Roadmap**

Since joining Blockchains on this project in late January, I have re-written the
roadmap twice. This is the third time. I have learned that ordered lists and
timelines are not effective, since external factors (requests from leadership,
new developer talent, new knowledge that necessarily changes my thinking, etc)
dictate constant reorienting. Instead, my roadmap has started looking more like
a generalized “to do” list, most of which all happening at the same time.

Better strategies for roadmapping appreciated

Coordinate with Colony to assess to what degree their platform might work, what
changes would need to be made to our model and/or theirs.

Coordinate with DAOstack to assess to what degree their platform might work,
what changes would need to be made to our model and/or theirs.

Design a set of potential models based off of this information and independent
research/local developer input

More closely define board responsibilities: governance protocols for various
areas of decision-making (ex: do some stakeholder groups get more of a say in
certain types of decisions? What might be the protocol for doing this?). How to
change organizational purpose/mission. Bylaws.

Continue internal, employee-focused blockchain education efforts

Work with leadership to encourage more worker-self management and horizontal
team building

Pilot governance models to whatever degree possible – off-chain and on.

Work with developer team to build out tech stack to make existing platforms suit
our needs, or build new platform if necessary (please god no)
