Definition of a high-level technical specification means that I have identified
which tech stacks we will use, that I understand from a very high level that
what we want is possible with them, and delegated the work to developers to
complete:

-   Write a full report of the tech stacks we want to use, and a
    whitepaper-esque non-technical document describing their integration.
