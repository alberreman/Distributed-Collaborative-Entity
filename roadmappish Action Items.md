**List of action-items, roughly ordered-ish: A “roadmap”**

**On-Chain Decision-Making // Aragon Play DAO**

Purpose: employee preference signaling, collaborative decision-making, web 3
skill building

Ordered action items:

-   Metamask setup and Rinkeby Test ETH faucet training \|\| One week out, led
    by Haley

-   Set up Aragon Tokenized Democracy. Open invite for participation. Include
    Rebekah

-   Collaborate with HR/Elaina/culture committee to see if they are making any
    decisions we might be able to vote on. Default to things like lunch, events.
    Must be significant enough people will have an opinion

-   Create tutorial for Aragon voting

-   Give training in voting, send out tutorial

-   First round of votes

-   Work out any kinks

-   Second round of votes

-   Can we use this system for actual money and more meaningful decisions?

**Bill of Rights**

**Purpose:** Define what the rights of customers, employees, collaborative
partners, etc, are.

**Possible collaborators:**

Internal: Rebekah, Jeff, Christoph, CLD, Berns, company-wide forum

**Ordered Action Items:**

-   Co-working draft in shared drive

-   Send out to company/interested parties. Request for comments

-   Edit

-   Submit to Jeff

**Decision Tree**

**Purpose:** Define the range of decisions that must be made, who might be
responsible for making them, and by what means. Will be used in “constitutional”
document.

**Possible collaborators:**

Internal: Rebekah or Jeff

**Ordered Action Items:**

-   Start with Yalda’s

-   Draft, feedback, revise

-   Add to larger document

**Reputation System Pilot**

**Purpose:** Begin to establish a workable reputation system that can later be
leveraged to weight voting power and build horizontal accountability.

**Potential collaborators:**

Internal: Rebekah, Jeff Benson.

External: UNR business/HR/social sciences/sociology/applied anthropology

**Ordered action items:**

-   Create survey

-   Pilot the pilot on the CLD team, make edits

-   Coordinate facilitation with HR, team leads, the Berns bros

    -   Reward/incentive structure?

-   Employee announcement and rollout

-   After 1 month, evaluations/review of UI

-   Write and publish analysis

-   Refine system, repeat

**Define stakeholder group-level reputation protocol**

**Purpose**: the amount of say a stakeholder group has in board-level decisions
should be defined by the degree to which it is affected by and affecting the
success of our company

**Potential collaborators:**

Internal: Rebekah, Jeff Benson.

External: UNR business/HR/social sciences/sociology/applied anthropology

**Criteria** (no action-items defined – more of a brainstorming/whiteboarding
situation):

-   Must not incentivize race to the bottom (or top for that matter)

-   Some kind of checks-and-balances system, maybe Colony’s.

-   Must be workable even if stakeholder group does not have any reputation
    system internally.

-   Voting power and profit rights are not equal – reputation system is for
    voting

-   Must not make people act like Mean Girls

**Colony Model**

**Purpose:** compare DAOstack’s ability to facilitate what we’re looking for
with Colony’s to determine if we should build out either, neither, or both.

**Potential Collaborators:**

**External:** Colony

**Action Items:**

Refine proposal based on Jeff’s feedback

Coordinate with Colony to create documentation about this model

Coordinate with colony to consider formalized collaboration

**DAOStack model**

**Purpose:** compare DAOstack’s ability to facilitate what we’re looking for
with Colony’s to determine if we should build out either, neither, or both.

**Potential Collaborators:**

DAOstack, Christoph/devs

**Action items:**

-   Meet with DAOstack to discuss to what degree they might be interested in
    collaboration

-   Develop model (if not provided by them, then hopefully reviewed by them or
    other blockchain developers)

-   Present to Jeff and David

**Write white paper**

**Purpose:** Articulate the interplay between social and tech for the DCE. Right
now much is unarticulated, undefined, or disconnected.

**Possible Collaborators:**

**Eternal:** folks from whatever tech stack we use.

**Internal:** devs/Christoph, Rebekah

**Legal Considerations**

**Purpose:** Christoph emphasized taking care of legal considerations first, so
that we can design the system within legal parameters. Jeff suggests that this
is not necessary, and that we can build The Dream, and then modify it if we have
to. My assessment is that we should design the social protocol, and define some
potential tech solutions to implement it (in order to even ask whether it is
legal), but assure legal status prior to building.

**Possible collaborators:**

**External:** legal team.

**Internal**: Lee? Christoph?? Delegate to Jeff probably

**Defining By-laws**

**Purpose:** creating one central document that defines responsibilities and
roles on board. Makes sense (?) that this would be done after legal approval.

**Potential Collaborators:**

**External:** UNR Business

**Internal:** Mary, Rainik, Rebekah

**“Concludes” with The Doc**

**The Doc – the one where I am “done” designing and am now implementing and
refining.**

**Constitutional**: Includes: the process for amending rules, the voting
protocol, profit-sharing, values, “bill of rights.”

**Technical:** whitepaper

Then, the code-type buidling begins. Or maybe it happens earlier than this.
