After a series of unsuccessful proposals and months of failed communication efforts, I am starting back from the beginning -
with a new (old) boss and a new communication strategy. Previous efforts to understand the reasoning behind and definitions 
of stakeholder groups have been unsuccessful, as have been my efforts to understand what "full stakeholder control" means. 
In another attempt to understand the former, I have outlined the stakeholder groups heretofore mentioned and my understanding 
of how Jeff sees these groups and why he wanted to include them - with no commentary or judgement made whatsoever - just to clarify.
In an attempt to understand the desired level and type of stakeholder control, I have outlined a spectrum of possibilities for 
stakeholder involvement in governance - all of which could be understood as allowing "full control" to stakeholders.
